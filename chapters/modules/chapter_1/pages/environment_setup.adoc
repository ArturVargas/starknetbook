== Setting up your local development environment

This section will guide you through setting up your local development environment for StarkNet development, covering the following topics:

* Installing prerequisites
* Installing the `starknet` CLI
* Installing the Cairo compiler

=== Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/[Python 3.9]
* https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Rust]

=== StarkNet CLI Installation

To install the StarkNet CLI, follow these steps:

* *Set up your virtual environment*:

We recommend working inside a Python virtual environment. This isolates your project's dependencies from your system's global Python installation. To create and activate a virtual environment, you can use either `venv` or `pyenv`.

  a. Using `venv`:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  # Create a virtual environment named "cairo_venv"
  python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
  # Activate the virtual environment
  source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
  ----

  b. Using `pyenv`:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  # Install pyenv
  curl https://pyenv.run | bash

  # Add the following lines to your .bashrc or .zshrc
  export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
  eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

  # Restart your terminal and run the following commands
  pyenv install 3.9.0
  pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 cairo_venv
  pyenv activate cairo_venv
  ----

After creating and activating the virtual environment, you should see `(cairo_venv)` in the command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active, for example:

[source, bash]
----
(cairo_venv) satoshi@nakamoto-notebook %
----

* *Install the necessary dependencies for your operating system*:

Before installing the StarkNet CLI, you need to install some system-specific dependencies. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

  a. Ubuntu:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
  ----

  b. Mac:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  brew install gmp
  ----

Once you have installed the system-specific dependencies, proceed with installing the Python packages required for StarkNet CLI:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
  ----

These Python packages provide cryptographic and mathematical functionality needed by the StarkNet CLI.

* *Install the StarkNet CLI*:

Now that you have set up the environment and installed the dependencies, you can install the StarkNet CLI. Follow these steps:

  a. Uninstall any previous version of `cairo-lang`:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  pip uninstall cairo-lang
  ----

  b. Install the latest version of `cairo-lang`:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  pip install cairo-lang
  ----

After you have installed the StarkNet CLI, verify your installation by checking the version:

  [source, bash]
  ----
  starknet --version
  ----

The output should show the installed version of StarkNet CLI. Make sure the version matches https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases[the latest release].


=== Cairo Compiler Installation

To install the Cairo compiler, follow these steps:

. Clone the Cairo repository and set it up:

[source, bash]
----
# Go to your $HOME directory
cd ~/
# Clone the Cairo compiler repo to a folder called .cairo in your home directory
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/ .cairo

# Checkout the working branch and generate the release binaries
cd .cairo/
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-alpha.6
cargo build --all --release
----

. Add Cairo executables to your PATH:

Update your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to add the Cairo binaries to your `PATH` environment variable:

   [source, bash]
   ----
   # Add the command below to your .bashrc or .zshrc
   export PATH="$HOME/.cairo/target/release:$PATH"
   ----

Open a new shell and check that the following command returns a version number:

   [source, bash]
   ----
   cairo-compile --version
   ----

Congratulations! Your local development environment for StarkNet is now set up. You can now start building, deploying, and interacting with Cairo smart contracts.

=== Docker Cairo Installation

*Prerequisites*:

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

    * https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

From your terminal execute:

[source, bash]
  ----
  docker pull artudev19/cairo-env:1.0.0-alpha.6
  ----

This command will download the image from Docker

In Docker, we can run a container from an image by executing `docker run`.Sometimes we want to make some information persistent. To do this, we need to use a volume, to mount a volume we need to pass the flag `-v from_host_path:to_container_path`.Thus, all the content in the host_path will be reflected in the container(It is worth mentioning that if you specify a path in the container that does not exist, Docker will create it automatically.)

[source, bash]
  ----
  docker run -it --name stark-env -v Desktop/stark-apps/contracts:/contracts artudev19/cairo-env:1.0.0-alpha.6
  ----

This command will start to run a container with the name `stark-env`(Make sure that you docker daemon is running) and this will open a terminal where we can start to execute the starknet and cairo commands.
In the example above all the cairo contracts from my local machine will be in the directory `stark-app/contracts` but in the container will be in the `contracts` path.

[source, bash]
  ----
  starknet --version
  ----

The output should show the installed version of StarkNet CLI. Make sure the version matches https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases[the latest release].

[source, bash]
   ----
   cairo-compile --version
   ----

For the next time that you want to run the container execute:

[source, bash]
   ----
   docker start stark-dapp
   ----

To connect to the running container execute:

[source, bash]
   ----
   docker exec -it stark-dapp zsh
   ----

Congratulations! Your Docker development environment for StarkNet is now set up. You can now start building, deploying, and interacting with Cairo smart contracts.
